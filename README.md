# Etch-A-Sketch

This is a basic implementation of the popular children's drawing tool called 'Etch-A-Sketch.' Through this project, I developed my DOM manipulation skills using vanilla JavaScript in a separate file to alter the color of grid cells, and toggle extra functionality such as variable colors or an erasor tool. To develop this project further, I would implement more flexibility in the choice of the drawing tool colour, or maybe try to spice up the look of the page and organise the buttons better.
